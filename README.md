A Voxel Rendering Pipeline in CUDA for Real-time Indirect Illumination
======================

Dave Kotfis and Jiawei Wang
CIS 565 Final Project â€“ Fall 2014

Goal - Implement a voxel rendering pipeline in CUDA capable of real-time global illumination.

Approach
- Utilize open source VoxelPipe library from NVidia to get up and running quickly.
- Reuse our CUDA Rasterizer to visualize the result and check our progress.
- Build a Sparse Voxel Octree representation on the GPU.
- Implement octree cone tracing for indirect illumination by Crassin et. al.
- Compare performance against our CUDA Pathtracer.

##Phase I Progress:

- Completed OpenGL Equivalent Rasterization Pipeline with quick swap to CUDA Rasterizer.
- Integrated NVidia VoxelPipe
- Added conversion kernels that can create a cube-ized mesh to render through the standard rasterizers. Works with both OpenGL and CUDA rasterization.

##Phase II Progress:

- Port to Linux
- Texture Mapping (in progress)
- Increased efficiency for 1024^3 voxels
- GPU SVO (in progress)

Building Voxel Octree
---------------------
Two points of octree implementation:
 - Only pixels to be actually displayed need to be computed, with the actual screen resolution limiting the level of voxel detail required (limits the computational cost during rendering)
 
 - Interior voxels, fully enclosed voxels, are unnecessary to be included in the 3D data set (limits the amount of 3D voxel data, which is the storage space)

##Phase III Progress

- Texture Mapping in VoxelPipe is Complete
- SVO Cube Extraction is Complete
- Filling values to interior SVO nodes is Complete

##Bloopers

This is what happens when not enough memory is allocated for the SVO.
