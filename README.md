======================

See our results on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/UgqYFQuIGmc)

Dave Kotfis and Jiawei Wang
CIS 565 Final Project â€“ Fall 2014

Goal - Implement a voxel rendering pipeline in CUDA capable of real-time global illumination.

Approach
- Utilize open source VoxelPipe library from NVidia to get up and running quickly.
- Reuse our CUDA Rasterizer to visualize the result and check our progress.
- Build a Sparse Voxel Octree representation on the GPU.
- Implement octree cone tracing for indirect illumination by Crassin et. al.
- Compare performance against our CUDA Pathtracer.

##Phase I Progress:

- Completed OpenGL Equivalent Rasterization Pipeline with quick swap to CUDA Rasterizer.
- Integrated NVidia VoxelPipe
- Added conversion kernels that can create a cube-ized mesh to render through the standard rasterizers. Works with both OpenGL and CUDA rasterization.

##Phase II Progress:

- Port to Linux
- Texture Mapping (in progress)
- Increased efficiency for 1024^3 voxels
- GPU SVO (in progress)

##Phase III Progress

- Texture Mapping in VoxelPipe is Complete
- SVO Cube Extraction is Complete
- Filling values to interior SVO nodes is Complete
- Added the ability to extract cubes from SVO at arbitrary resolution

This shows the stanford dragon with textures mapped into the voxel grid, then filled into the SVO and extracted.

This is the same as before, though the cubes rendered are extracted from a higher level in the octree than the original voxelization, so the values are mip-mapped.

##Performance Analysis

Data Structure Sizes:

| Model | Resolution | # Occupied Voxels | # SVO Nodes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bunny | 128 | 3,234 | 9,656 |
|  | 256 | 11,603 | 38,408 |
|  | 512 | 43,126 | 151,552 |
| Dragon | 128 | 6,327 | 14,696 |
|  | 256 | 20,604 | 58,536 |
|  | 512 | 69,865 | 225,360 |

The following timing statistics were produced using an NVidia GTX 770.
Data Construction / Cube Extraction Timing:

| Model | Resolution | Voxelization | Voxel Grid to Cubes | SVO from Voxel Grid | SVO to Cubes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bunny | 128 | 16.2 ms | 8.46 ms | 1.85 ms | 7.78 ms |
|  | 256 | 54.2 ms | 19.7 ms | 2.07 ms | 22.6 ms |
|  | 512 | 203.9 ms | 48.6 ms | 2.3 ms | 39.9 ms |
| Dragon | 128 | 26.8 ms | 12.1 ms | 1.06 ms | 12.06 ms |
|  | 256 | 49 ms | 30.5 ms | 2.79 ms | 33.6 ms |
|  | 512 | 221 ms | 90.9 ms | 2.7 ms | 71.8 ms |

| Voxelize | Model | CUDA Render Time | CUDA FPS | OpenGL Render Time | OpenGL FPS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Without Voxelization | Dragon | 47 ms | 18 | 15 ms | 60 |
|  | Two-Cows | 16 ms | 35 | 0~5 ms | 60 |
|  | All Three* | 55 ms | 17 | 15 ms | 58 |
|  | Bunny | 31 ms | 29 | ~0 ms | 60 |
| With Voxelization | Dragon | 156 ms | 5 | 31 ms | 30 |
|  | Two-Cows | 23 ms | 27 | ~0 ms | 60 |
|  | All Three | 141 ms | 7 | 16 ms | 34 |
|  | Bunny | 109 ms | 10 | 15 ms | 47 |

##Bloopers

This is what happens when not enough memory is allocated for the SVO.
